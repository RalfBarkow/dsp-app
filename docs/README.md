# User guide for the Knora web app

We built the user guidelines with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and published them on Github: <https://dhlab-basel.github.io/Kuirl>.

## Local installation

The documentation is stored in folder `/docs`. To run it locally, you have to switch to this folder `cd docs` and start with

```bash
$ jekyll serve
```

Point your web browser to <http://localhost:4000>

## Usage
All documentation about the usage of Jekyll together with the Just-the-Docs theme is described here: <https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/>
