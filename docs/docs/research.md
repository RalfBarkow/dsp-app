Once you found the desired sources, you can (re)view them and annotate the source itself, the media file, or single metadata values. If you select more than one source, you can compare them in a side-by-side view, link them, edit them all at once, or save them in a collection. A collection is similar to a playlist in a music app or shopping basket in an online store.

## Display a source

The Knora web app app offers different source views for different media types. There's a viewer for still images, moving images, audio and document files. You can open them from the list of search results. Depending on the media type, Knora web app offers different tools to work on the source.

In a still image source, you're able to draw regions on the image and to annotate or transcribe this region. Usually a still image source is used for book pages, photographs, postcards, letters etc.

In time-based sources like moving image or audio document, you can mark sequences on the timeline. A transcription tool helps to annotate and to transcribe the sequence.

Knora web app offers a graph view to visualize the connection of a selected source. The graph view is a powerful tool, because you will find more information about the source by clicking through the nodes.

Additionally you can work on the source directly, e.g, transcribe a moving image or a taped interview or mark regions of interest on still images and on documents.

## Select more than one source

By selecting more than one source, you can edit them all at once, add them to a collection, share or connect them. Or you compare them as shown in the next paragraph.

## Compare the sources

You can compare from two to six source objects at the same time side by side.

## Annotate and connect your data (sources and / or metadata)

A main feature of the flexible data storage that Knora web app uses is the possibility to annotate and link sources and their metadata. An annotation can be a small note about a date like "Not sure about the birthdate of this person. There's another date mentioned in the source XYZ". Inside the note, it's possible to link to another source.
Links in Knora web app are always bi-directional. If you link source A with source B, then source B knows about this connection. If you find source B, you have the connection to source A as well.

## Export, save or share the data

Data sets and metadata extracted through a search can be exported as CSV, XML, or other predefined file formats.
It's also possible to store fulltext, advanced, and expert search queries to reuse them later to store source objects in a collection similar to a playlist of a music app or a shopping basket.
