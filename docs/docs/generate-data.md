# Generate data and / or add your data

Once your data model is ready, you're able to add data. The Knora web app app offers several possibilities to add data, whether you are starting from scratch or importing data from another program.

## Start from scratch

When a project starts from scratch, you will enter and generate new data directly in the Knora web app app itself. Generating new data can be done one by one with a form or with a table-based (Excel like) tool.

- Upload the files, e.g., the actual audio file of an interview or images of the photographs discussed in the interview
- Augment the metadata
- In case of interview transcriptions from audio or video files, Knora web app will offer a simple transcription tool

## Organize data and create additional sources

The workspace of the Knora web app app includes tools to connect different sources even if they're not in the same project (linkage), to comment on a source and on their metadata fields (annotate), and to transcribe audio-visual material. These actions will generate more data and will help to find specific sources and their relations easily.
It's possible to collect different sources and to store them in an individual collection. You can define more than one collection. You can share collections and invite other users to collaborate.
