The most important step in the project is the definition of the data model. SUID offers a tool to create data models easely. First you have to know about your data and sources you want to work with. The data model can be flexible and customizable. With SUID you can comply with the FAIR data standard, but compliance is not required to analyze your data.

The questions to answer in creating your data model:
"What kind of data do I have in my project?"
"What are the sources and what are their metadata?"

For example: You interviewed 20 people. During these interviews, which you taped, you talked about photographs. Of all the data collected during the project, the most important are:
- audio-files of the interview
- transcribed text of conversations (or you can transcribe the files inside the web app)
- photographs
- data about the person you interviewed
- location where the photograph was taken

Diagram 1 shows the relationships of the data by source type from these experiences.

## Select your SOURCE TYPES

In the data model editor, you have to select your source types from a predefined list on the right-hand side. Later, you can customize the source type or define an additional default source type, if the one you need doesn't exist as a default.

## Select the METADATA fields for each source type (optional)

## Customize the SOURCE TYPES and the METADATA fields (optional)

## Connect SOURCE TYPES in the data model (optional)
