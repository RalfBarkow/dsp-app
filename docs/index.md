## Getting started

KUIRL (Knora User Interface Research Layer) is an intuitive, easy to use web-based application placed on top of Knora to directly use its powerful data management functionalities. With KUIRL, the researchers will be able to add data models, search, browse, and work with their qualitative data as easily as they could with a desktop data management tool. In addition, data models and data will automatically follow accepted standards, be interoperable, findable, and re-usable. Researchers and scholars with small data sets will have access to long-term accessibility to keep their research data alive, guaranteeing longevity of the data.

### Registration

You can use the Knora web app with restricted access as guest. Otherwise you'll need a login. At the moment you have to contact the [DaSCH Team](https://dasch.swiss/team) to get access. In the future (end of 2020) we will support the SWITCH edu-ID.
